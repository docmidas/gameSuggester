use users controller even for register
cosider using session controller to handle sessions:
-POST/sessions
-DEL /sessions


ESTIMATE practice!!
??run mongo in backgground
implement version control: {expected: .5, 
                            actual: .5, github BS}
indentation cleanup: 1
add ratings as model: 1

app.js: get rid of salt secret: 
started skipping game entries, during posting!! why????

.emd to keep things secret
referencing, not populating or inheriting
body vs params
1 line of whitespace between routes and verbs


.emd
'login', not 'sessioning'
front end for a user to create ratings
stretch add library
